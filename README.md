**Brain-wide association study is a method to analyse voxel-by-voxel resting-state fMRI data. It simply involves (1) calculating the functional connectivities between pairwise voxel across the whole brain; (2) Testing the difference/correlation between functional connectivities and a phenotype of interests; (3) Performing multiple comparison correction using a novel Gaussian Random Field based approach, which generalized the widely-used cluster-size inferece to functional connectivities.**


I am going to release a new python package soon in the future.
